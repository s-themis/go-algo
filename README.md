# EXPERIMENTAL

The code in this repository has an unstable API at the moment.

# Packages

This is a selection of interesting algorithms developed over the years, to work with
graphs and distances.

### assign

This is an implementation of the [Hungarian algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm) to solve the [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem).

The algorithm was generalized to work with arbitrary cost types, to facilitate handling
of more involved relationships between objects.

### tarjan

An implementation of [Tarjan's strongly connected components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) algorithm, which is often used as a
more resilient topological sort and cycle detector.

### strdist

An efficient implementation of the classic [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) algorithm.

The algorithm was generalized to work over arbitrary costs, which is then leveraged as a fast
implementaion for wildcard matching (*, **, ?).

### listdist

This is strdist reshaped to work with lists instead of strings.

### listedit

Similar to listdist but also returns the exact edit steps to transform one list to another.

The full edit distance matrix is kept in memory in order to calculate the edit steps, so if only distance is required use listdist instead.
